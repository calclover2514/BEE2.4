# BEE2.4 Automatic Installer (Windows)
![Bee2 Installer](https://imgur.com/LhTFDyo.png)

This is an automatic installer for *[**BEE2** (Better Extended Editor for Portal 2)](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4)*

Written in *[NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page)*, this installer will incorporate **BEE2** into the system and add it to the Windows start menu

An uninstaller has been included as well.

In addition, the **BEE2** packages are included in the installer.

I will update the installer with every new release of **BEE2**.

The newest release of **BEE2** Automatic Installer can be found *[here (v4.37.0)](https://github.com/programmer2514/BEE2.4-Installer-Automatic/releases/latest/)*, however, it is currently recommended to use *[v4.36.1](https://github.com/programmer2514/BEE2.4-Installer-Automatic/releases/tag/v4.36.1)* due to some new bugs
