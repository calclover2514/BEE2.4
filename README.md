# BEE2 Automatic Installer
This is a rewrite of my [original installer](https://github.com/programmer2514/BEE2.4-Installer-Automatic/tree/nsis) in *[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)*.

It includes all of the features of the original, but is a downloader, so it takes up almost no space on it's own and should always update the application to the latest version.

This may have BEE2 integration in the future, but as of right now, it is a standalone program.

The latest release can be found *[here](https://github.com/programmer2514/BEE2.4-Installer-Automatic/releases/latest/)*.
